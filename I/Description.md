**I (ISP)**  - The Interface Segregation Principle

### From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### By Jeffery Way
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use.

**Notice!**
This code is not working, just as an example!
