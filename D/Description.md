**D (DIP)**  - The Dependency inversion principle

### From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

### By Jeffery Way
There's a common misunderstanding that "dependency inversion" is simply another way to say "dependency injection." However, the two are not the same.
The depend on abstractions not on concretions!
All of these about decoupling code. The high level code(not have many details, just abstraction) should not never depend on the low(code with details and specifics) level code.

**Notice!**
This code is not working, just as an example!
