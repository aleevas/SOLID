**O (OCP)**  - The Openâ€“closed principle

### From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

### By Jeffery Way
Change behavior without modifying source code...
**Steps**:
 - Separate extensible behavior behind an interface, and flip the dependencies. 

**Notice!**
This code is not working, just as an example!
