**L (LSP)**  - The Liskov Substitution Principle

### From [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."

### By Jeffery WayC
Coined by Barbara Liskov, this principle states that any implementation of an abstraction (interface) should be substitutable in any place that the abstraction is accepted.

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.


**Notice!**
This code is not working, just as an example!
